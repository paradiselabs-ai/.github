## 🌴 Welcome to Paradise

ParadiseLabs is an AI startup focused on building next-level domain-specific Agents. We're exploring innovative concepts to create a new generation of AI agents that can truly understand and operate within specialized domains.

## 🚀 Our Mission

We're developing GLUE, a streamlined framework for building self-learning, autonomous AI agents in an easy and efficient way. Our approach leverages "Magnetic Field" technology and "Adhesive Tool Binding" which allows tools to be shared between agents, enabling them to work autonomously while intelligently managing workflow to prevent bottlenecks and API failures.

## 🔍 Current Projects

- **GLUE** - Check out our framework repository at [GLUE](https://github.com/paradiselabs-ai/GLUE-fw)
- **DeadDevelopers Community** - Join our community of developers at [DEADDEVELOPERS](https://github.com/paradiselabs-ai/DeadDevelopers)

## 🤝 Get Involved

We're always looking for passionate individuals who want to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI. If you're interested in contributing,

## 💡 What's Next

We're working hard on refining and expanding GLUE. Stay tuned for updates and announcements about our progress.

## 🔮 Our Philosophy

We believe in hands-on, practical solutions over theoretical approaches. Our goal is to democratize AI agent creation so that anyone can build powerful, domain-specific tools.
